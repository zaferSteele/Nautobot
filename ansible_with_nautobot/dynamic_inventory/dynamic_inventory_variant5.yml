# Ansible Dynamic Inventory Configuration (Nautobot GraphQL Plugin)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures Ansible to dynamically retrieve device hostnames,
# their location, config context, and interface details (including IP and MAC),
# and group them by their location and NAPALM driver type from a Nautobot instance
# using its GraphQL inventory plugin.

# ----------------------
# Prerequisites:
# ----------------------
# Before running this inventory file, you must set the following environment variables:
#
# Option 1 – Export directly in your shell:
#   Example:
#     export NAUTOBOT_URL=http://192.168.5.1:8001
#     export NAUTOBOT_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
#     export NTC_NET_USERNAME=admin
#     export NTC_NET_PASSWORD=admin
#
# Option 2 – Use the `creds.env` file:
#   1. Navigate to the `ansible_with_nautobot` directory.
#   2. Open the `creds.env` file and fill in your Nautobot URL and token.
#   3. Save the file.
#   4. Run:  source creds.env
#
# Note: Environment variables set using either method are not persistent
#       and must be re-applied after a reboot or new shell session.

# ----------------------
# Testing the inventory:
# ----------------------
# To verify that Ansible can retrieve devices and groups from Nautobot, run from within the dynamic_inventory folder:
#   ansible-inventory -i dynamic_inventory_variant5.yml --list

# ----------------------
# Running playbooks:
# ----------------------
# Playbooks that use this dynamic inventory are located in:
#   playbooks_using_dynamic_inventory/
#
# Example (from the `ansible_with_nautobot` directory):
#   ansible-playbook -i dynamic_inventory/dynamic_inventory_variant5.yml playbooks_using_dynamic_inventory/config_replace_ios_with_config_context.yml

  - platform.napalm_driver                     # Groups devices by NAPALM driver type (requires platform data in Nautobot)
