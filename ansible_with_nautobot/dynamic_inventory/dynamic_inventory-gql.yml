# This YAML defines a dynamic Ansible inventory using the Nautobot GraphQL plugin.
# It connects to the specified Nautobot API endpoint, queries devices filtered by location (London),
# retrieves details such as name, tenant, platform, device type, and role,
# includes each device's primary IP (required for ansible_host),
# and groups the devices in the inventory based on tenant, platform, model, role, and location.

# REQUIREMENTS:
# Installation of netutils: "pip install netutils"
# Instalation of pynautobot: "pip install pynautobot"

# The GraphQL query section, defines what data to retreive and how to filter it
query:
  devices:             # We are querying for devices
    filters:           # Apply filters to limit the results
      location: London # Only retrieve devices located in London
    id:                # Include the device's unique ID in the results
    name:              # Include the device name
    primary_ip4:       # Inlcude Ipv4 address
      host:            # specifically, the host IP address
    location:          # Include nested data about the location

  - tenant.name        # Group devices by tenant name
  - platform.name      # Group devices by platform name
  - device_type.model  # Group devices by device model
  - role.name          # Group devices by role name
