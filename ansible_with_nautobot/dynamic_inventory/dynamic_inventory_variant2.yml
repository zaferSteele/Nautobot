# This is an Ansible dynamic inventory configuration file using the Nautobot inventory plugin.
# It connects to a Nautobot instance, retrieves devices, and groups them dynamically.

# Before running this inventory yaml file, make sure you run these commands in your shell, the following URL and Token are just examples:
#   export NAUTOBOT_URL=http://192.168.5.1:8001
#   export NAUTOBOT_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
# Ansible will automatically use these environment variables in the Nautobot lookup.
# Playbooks for using this dynamic inventory is located in the "playbooks_using_dynamic_inventory" folder
#  Example command from the ansible_with_nautobot directory: ansible-playbook -i inventory/dynamic_inventory_variant2.yml playbooks_using_dynamic_inventory/test_dynamic_inventory_groups.yml

# Define how to group the devices in the inventory dynamically.
# Devices will be grouped by their roles, locations, and platforms.
group_by:
  - device_roles                                # Group devices by their role (e.g., router, switch, edge)
  - locations                                   # Group devices by their location
  - platforms                                   # Group devices by platform (e.g., Cisco IOS, Arista EOS)

# Filter which devices to include in the inventory.
# Only include devices that have a primary IP address defined.

  - has_primary_ip: 'true'                      # Filter for devices that have a primary IP
